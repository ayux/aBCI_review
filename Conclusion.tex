\section{Conclusion}
For years the concept of functional connectivity maps has been used to study the brain activity but not for classification of emotions. In this paper, we studied the concepts of brain functional connectivity and compared different methods of estimating functional connectivity on EEG signals for 23 subjects in order to classify pleasant and unpleasant emotions during odour perception. By considering the maps as networks, physical statistics and graph theory based features are extracted and used for designing SVM classifiers with RBF kernel. The best classification accuracy based on Cohen's Kappa is achieved at $0.11 \pm 0.17$ , which is significantly without random guessing. The results indicates that features estimated from 216-channel Nonlinear Regression Analysis estimated functional connectivity can be used to classify pleasant and unpleasant emotions during odour perception with a higher accuracy.
